= memholes
:experimental:

A collection of recollection streams.
This is less of a singular mod and more of a collection of various ones.
Maybe one day we will figure out how to combine these into one mod.
For now, you can view installation instructions for each of them below.

NOTE: The installation methods here may show you a scary looking warning about making sure you trust the code you're pasting into the console.
	This is good advice.
	Don't blindly trust us.
	Read through the source code first to make sure you trust what we're running in your browser.
